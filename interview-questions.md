# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: conditional statements are "if" statements that will deteremine if something is true or not. If the statement is true then code will run. If not then it won't. A conditional statement is also known as a boolean which if the statement is true, then the code will run. if the statement is false, then it will not.

  Researched answer: Conditional statements determine whether or not the code can run. The different types of conditional in JavaScript include:
  “If” statements: If the condition if true, the code specified in the "if" statement will execute.
  “Else” statements: If the same condition is false the code specified in the "else" statement will execute.
  “Else if” statements: If the same condition is false this specifies a new condition to exceute after "if", and "else" have executed.


1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git (global information tracker) is the program which is installed on the local machine (my laptop). Github is the online service where developers can upload programs.

  Researched answer: Git is a free open-source tool used for code management. It is a version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. Github if the online git repository service where multiple developers can to work together and store/exchange code. 



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: boolean is a conditional satement which handles decisions. Boolean uses if/else values to statement is true, the command will execute.

  Researched answer: if/else operators will return a boolean value.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: index point to a character within a string or array. for example in an array with three elements, each elements is given an index. the first element has an index of 0, the second and index of 1, and the third and index of 2.

  Researched answer: an index is the placement of a character in a string/element in an array. a value is the content of an element within an array.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: during a loop, it is the execution of code for a certain number of times or until the condition is met.

  Researched answer: an iteration operates on every item within the string or array. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: proper pair program techniqus include a driver and a navigator. the driver is the programmer while the navigator provides instruction. in order to be successful, pair programmers must have excellent communication skills. pair programming can allows each programmer to bring their experiences to the table. 

  Researched answer: the roles of each person is a driver and navigator. two sets of eyes are better than one and each could hold each other accountable.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: these are buil in methods in javascript that work in arrays.

2. Jest: created by facebook, Jest tests your code.

3. Objects: these are javaScript data types that contain key:value pairs stored in curly braces.

4. Method: Methods are action that can be executed on objects 

5. Classes: classes work like functions and they have thier own scope. Class names are always capitalized.
