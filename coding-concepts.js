// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
// const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:

// --------------------1) What will this log?

        // const cohort = "LEARN 2022"
        // console.log(cohort.length)

        // a) Your answer: this will log the length of the string which is 10.
        // b) Verify and explain: after running the code the answer was 10


// --------------------2) What will this log?

        // const greeting = "Hello World!"
        // console.log(greeting[4])

        // a) Your answer: this code is asking for the 4th index of "Hello World" which is the letter "o" because index starts at 0.
        // b) Verify and explain: the code returned the letter "o".


// --------------------3) What will this log?

        // const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
        // const index = 1
        // console.log(languages[index])

        // a) Your answer: this is asking for the 1st index of the given string. The index begins at zero so index 1 will return "Ruby".
        // b) Verify and explain: the code returned "Ruby"


// --------------------4) What will this log?

        // const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
        // console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

        // a) Your answer: I expect the string to change to all upper case. 
        // b) Verify and explain: the terminal returned "weekendDays toUpperCase   is not a function". in order for the string to change toUpperCase, the brackets on the string need to be changed to parentheses. 
            // const weekendDays = ("saturday, sunday")
            // console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())


// --------------------5) What will this log?

        // const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
        // console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)
    
        // a) Your answer: i think this will return a "3" or "number". i think "3" because the length of this array is "3". Or it could return "number" because length is measured in "number"s (primitive).
        // b) Verify and explain: it returned number because lenght is measured in numbers because length is measured in number. i ran a tes on the array below.
            // const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "boolean"]
            // console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)
                // this returned "object" because the array is made up of objects.
